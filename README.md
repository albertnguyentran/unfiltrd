#How it works
Handles text submission and calculates Bias (x) vs. Sentiment (y). Using npms NLP javscript library I was able to calculate sentiment and bias (by determining the clustering of key words).

#Why I made it
Unfiltrd detects the overall bias presented in a medium of text to better inform you of what you are reading.

#Tools and Technologies
ReactJs, Javascript NLP library, recharts
